    <h1>Quasi-connectivity</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Quasi-connectivity is a special property of three blocks: pistons, droppers, and dispensers.</p>
    <p>In short, any one of these blocks (which we'll call QC-able blocks) can be powered from one block above where they usually would. If the block above them would be powered, they'll be powered too.</p>
    <p>However, the weirdness arises when you account for <a href="updates">block updates</a>. QC was not an intentional behaviour when it was first introduced, so block update ranges don't account for QC. As a result, QC-able blocks may be powered but fail to realise it, until they're updated by some other source. This also applies to depowering.</p>
